&lt;p&gt;Using static site generators is a good way to start with web-development, since it does not require advanced web-development skills. Actually, you need to learn how the set-up
and configuration files in your project work and some generators, as the case of Jekyll, will provide you a way to edit the content with markdown which is, according to me, way easier than html.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Static site generators are suitable for a variety of websites with static structure whose content is different on different pages, e.g. blogs, portfolios and etc.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">What type of projects are they suitable for?

It was created by facebook in order to promote integration 
between facebook and other websites by allowing them to become rich “graph” objects with some functionality of other facebook objects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can make use of Open Graph by adding some specific meta tags into the source code of your website. Specifically for my website, I added some meta tags in order to sites, e.g. facebook, display a graph object with title, url and image of my site once it’s URL is shared there.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Open Graph protocol is a protocol, created in 2010, used for integrating your site with social media.

&lt;p&gt;Robots.txt is a txt file that is used as a filter for search engines and search bots, e.g. googlebot. It is through this file that the developers define, e.g., access permissions to specific pages and resources that belongs to a specific website. It’s syntax is simple and it is saved in the root folder of the website project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My website has nothing that I would not allow to be accessed and, thus, my robots.txt is set to allow access to all its resources and pages.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">What is robots.txt and how have you configure it for your site?</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Pre-compiling your CSS?</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2019/12/02/precompiling-css.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Pre-compiling your CSS?" /><published>2019-12-02T13:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2019-12-02T13:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2019/12/02/precompiling-css</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2019/12/02/precompiling-css.html">&lt;p&gt;CSS preprocessors are programs that generate CSS out of an own syntax.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used for the most, nesting. The css code that I needed to write was considerable smaller that what it would have been if I used regular CSS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;some-of-the-benefits-of-using-a-css-pre-processor&quot;&gt;Some of the benefits of using a CSS pre-processor:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Less CSS to maintain.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;DRY CSS&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Better organized CSS&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You can add some logic and use variables and make calculations for generating CSS.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;According to this article: https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-advantages-disadvantages-of-using-CSS-pre-processors , it solves browser compatibility problems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;some-disadvantages&quot;&gt;Some disadvantages:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You need to learn a new way to write the css, if you want to take full advantage of its features.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Debbuging is harder.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Increases building time.&lt;/li&gt;
