It was created by facebook in order to promote integration 
between facebook and other websites by allowing them to become rich “graph” objects with some functionality of other facebook objects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can make use of Open Graph by adding some specific meta tags into the source code of your website. Specifically for my website, I added some meta tags in order to sites, e.g. facebook, display a graph object with title, url and image of my site once it’s URL is shared there.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Open Graph protocol is a protocol, created in 2010, used for integrating your site with social media.

&lt;p&gt;Robots.txt is a txt file that is used as a filter for search engines and search bots, e.g. googlebot. It is through this file that the developers define, e.g., access permissions to specific pages and resources that belongs to a specific website. It’s syntax is simple and it is saved in the root folder of the website project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My website has nothing that I would not allow to be accessed and, thus, my robots.txt is set to allow access to all its resources and pages.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">What is robots.txt and how have you configure it for your site?</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Pre-compiling your CSS?</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/2019/12/02/precompiling-css.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Pre-compiling your CSS?" /><published>2019-12-02T13:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2019-12-02T13:00:00-05:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/2019/12/02/precompiling-css</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/2019/12/02/precompiling-css.html">&lt;h3 id=&quot;--compare-to-regular-css&quot;&gt;- Compare to regular CSS&lt;/h3&gt;
